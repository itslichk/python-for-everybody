# 🗂️ Lesson 9: Reading and Writing Files in Python

Welcome back! In this lesson, we’ll unlock a powerful new skill: working with files.  
This means your programs can now **store data permanently**—like saving notes, logs, or user input—even after the program ends.

Let’s dive into how Python reads and writes `.txt` files.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to:

- Open and read text files using Python  
- Write and append content to files  
- Use file modes like `'r'`, `'w'`, and `'a'`  
- Safely manage files using the `with` statement

---

## 📖 Reading Files

To read a file, use the `open()` function with mode `'r'` (read).

```python
file = open("data.txt", "r")
content = file.read()
print(content)
file.close()
```

### 🧠 Key Methods

- `read()` → Reads the entire file as one string  
- `readline()` → Reads one line at a time  
- `readlines()` → Returns a list of all lines

---

## ✍️ Writing to Files

Use mode `'w'` to write. This **overwrites** the file if it exists.

```python
file = open("output.txt", "w")
file.write("Hello, world!\n")
file.write("This is a second line.\n")
file.close()
```

---

## ➕ Appending to Files

Use mode `'a'` to **add** content without deleting existing data.

```python
file = open("output.txt", "a")
file.write("Adding a new line.\n")
file.close()
```

---

## ✅ Best Practice: `with` Statement

Using `with` automatically closes the file after use.

```python
with open("output.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

---

## 🔍 File Modes Summary

| Mode | Action                     |
|------|----------------------------|
| `'r'` | Read (default)             |
| `'w'` | Write (overwrite)          |
| `'a'` | Append                     |
| `'x'` | Create new file (error if exists) |
| `'b'` | Binary mode (for images, etc.) |

## 🧪 Practice Time

### 📝 Exercise 1: Save a Message

Write a program that:

- Asks the user for a message  
- Saves it to `message.txt`  
- Confirms the message was saved

---

### 📝 Exercise 2: Read a Poem

Create a file called `poem.txt` with 3 lines of text.  
Write a program that reads and prints each line.

## 🛠️ Mini Project: Simple Note Keeper

Build a basic note-taking app:

```python
while True:
    action = input("Choose: write / view / quit: ").lower()
    
    if action == "write":
        note = input("Enter your note: ")
        with open("notes.txt", "a") as file:
            file.write(note + "\n")
    elif action == "view":
        with open("notes.txt", "r") as file:
            print("Your notes:")
            print(file.read())
    elif action == "quit":
        break
    else:
        print("Invalid option.")
```

## 💬 Instructor Tip

> “Files are where your programs come alive. They let you save progress, store data, and build real tools. Once you master file handling, you’re ready to build apps that remember.”

In Lesson 10, we’ll explore:

- Handling errors with `try` and `except`  
- Writing programs that don’t crash  
- Making your code more reliable and user-friendly
